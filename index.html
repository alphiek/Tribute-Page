              to his professional endeavors, he always took great risks and proved how rich the world can be when you dare to embrace pure, boundless creativity. </p>
            <p>Discover the life and legend of Salvador Dali, and get to know the people, places and events that transformed this Spanish son into a surrealist sensation.</p>
